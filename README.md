# sitcounter
A sit counter for counting support tickets ingame.

The Repo includes the compiled exe for people who don't have the dependencies installed for Python.

For those who wish to view the source code i've included it here.

The downloaded Zip will flag as a virus as it uses a python module called "PyInput" which can be seen in the source code. The reason for this is this can be used to create a keylogger if done maliciously however as seen
in the code it uses it to capture when the user presses the # Key to update the count.


HOW TO USE:
1. Create a folder for the EXE and drag it in there. (IMPORTANT!)
2. Open the exe.
2. Drag the application to where you want it while playing.
3. Everytime you complete a sit press the # key and the counter will update.

The app will remember your sitcount even if you turn your computer off!

Have fun ;)
