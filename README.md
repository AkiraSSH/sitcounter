# sitcounter
A sit counter for counting support tickets ingame.

The most recent version using "2.0" no longer flags as a virus as it no longer uses the "Pyinput" Library.

It also is now automated so when you take your sits and you press "Close report" it will update the counter.

HOW TO INSTALL: 

Select Releases on the right hand side of the github.
Select "2.0"
Download zip file.
Run "Script.exe"

Either take a sit and ensure count increases OR open the "sit.png" file and maximise it and ensure the count updates by 1.
